<p>
A hundred years won’t put a mark on paper, <br>
It wouldn’t now, so why then? <br>
Do we fear the dust will haunt the margins - <br>
Cut, weave, and erase its way one day to the next, <br>
Leaving the faint notes of a pen, <br>
Once held with great respect. <br>
</p>
     
 <p>      
Through cold rain beats the path, <br>
The shimmer of a stone will meet your eye, <br>
As it shot its arc and to the ground, <br>
You are throwing the sun around the earth: <br>
Bound to its rhythms, it relies on you to see, <br>
Every star which hides behind a jagged countertop must rise to complement those free. <br>
